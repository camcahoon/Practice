How to create a new SSH key:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

List stuff in current dirctory:
- ls
- ls -la (long list and lists hidden files)

Make new directory:  
mkdir [dirctory name]

Change directories:  
cd [directory name]

Setup go in a dirctory:  
go mod init github.com/camcahoon/practice (example)

Push to a repo:
- git add [file name]
- git commit
- git push

Push to a new branch:
- git checkout -b [branch name]
- git push origin [branch name]

Delete a local branch:
- git branch -d [branch name]
- git branch -D [branch name] (if the former gives an error)

When committing, either use git commit -m "commit message" or use vi

When using vi, to write and quit do:  
:wq

Check what is ready to be added:  
git status

Set up a binary/build thing:  
go build

Use the binary:  
./[binary name]

Run a Go program:  
go run [file name]
