https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

List stuff in current dirctory:
ls
ls -la (long list and lists hidden files)

Make new directory:
mkdir [dirctory name]

Change directories:
cd [directory name]

Setup go in a dirctory:
go mod init github.com/camcahoon/practice (example)

Push to a repo:
git add [file name]

git commit

git push

When committing, either use git commit -m "commit message" or use vi

When using vi, to write and quit do:
:wq

Check what is ready to be added:
git status

Set up a binary/build thing:
go build

Use the binary:
./[binary name]

Run a Go program:
go run [file name]
